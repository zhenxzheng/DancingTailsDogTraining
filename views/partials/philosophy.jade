			p As a certified dog trainer and a member of the 
				a(href="http://www.petprofessionalguild.com/", target="_blank") Pet Professional Guild
				| , my mission is to provide the highest quality, force-free, scientific-based dog training and care to each of my clients and their furry family members. Dancing tails are a natural result because I attend to the physical, emotional, and environmental well being of the dogs in my care.
			p Certified in Training and Behavior Consultation from the 
				a(href="http://www.dogtraininginternshipacademy.com/", target="_blank") Dog Training Internship Academy
				|  in San Francisco, my training philosophy is based on animal learning theory, which explains how learning works and occurs. I use Classical and Operant Conditioning when designing the best training plan for your dog.

				span.green Classical Conditioning: 
				| Dogs learn through association.
			p Dogs learn that when one thing happens, another will follow. He doesn’t have to do anything to make the second thing happen.
			ul: li For example, Ivan Pavlov was the first to identify associative learning when his research dogs started salivating when they heard a tone prior to getting food. The dogs had learned that when they heard the tone, food was coming.

				span.green Operant Consitioning: 
				| Dogs learn through consequences.
			p Out of the four ways to increase or decrease behavior, I only use two: positive reinforcement and negative punishment. Both are humane training techniques, resulting in dancing tails and a strong bond between dog and handler.
			ul
				li 
					span.bold Positive Reinforcement: 
					| adding something good to increase a behavior
					ul: li For example, I ask Charlie to sit, he sits, and then he gets his favorite treat.
				li 
					span.bold Negative Punishment: 
					| delaying something good to decrease a behavior
					ul: li For example, Lola plays too rough, so I walk away.

			h2.green My take on dominance theory...
			p According to the Pet Professional Guild, “Dominance theory is an obsolete and aversive method of interacting with animals that has at its foundation incorrect and misinterpreted data which can result in damage to the animal-human relationship and cause behavioral problems in the animal.” Further explanation—all of which I wholly agree with—can be found on
